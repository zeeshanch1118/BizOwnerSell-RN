                    When everything goes as planned, a business owner builds
                    value in her business over time by increasing customers,
                    sales, and profit. When it comes time to exit the business,
                    whether for retirement or to pursue another venture, she
                    will be able to sell the earning capability of that business
                    to a buyer who sees an opportunity to take it even higher.
                    Unfortunately, things don’t always go as planned, and if the
                    business is unable to generate enough positive cash flow,
                    for legal, health, regulatory or other personal reasons,
                    that business may be forced to cease operations and close
                    its doors. While not necessarily a planned event, all is not
                    lost when a business shuts down. If the business owner has
                    material assets in the form of significant leasehold
                    improvements, FF&E, inventory, transferable permits and
                    licenses, or a coveted real estate location (whether owned
                    or with favorable lease terms), they may still be able to
                    find a buyer for these assets in place. In this type of
                    sale, the buyer is acquiring the assets of the business and
                    not an ongoing operation and its cash flow. Surprisingly,
                    far too many small business owners simply shutdown, without
                    realizing their business still has value. In fact, a
                    business sold for its assets alone can be quite valuable,
                    regardless of its financial performance, and many buyers are
                    searching specifically for these types of opportunities now
                    and will be increasingly common looking forward. In its Q2
                    2020 Economic Average Report, Yelp reports that 72,842 of
                    the businesses on its platform have permanently closed as of
                    July 10, 2020. This total includes 15,770 restaurants,
                    12,454 retail businesses, 4,897 in the beauty industry,
                    2,429 in the bars and nightlife category, and 1,930 in the
                    fitness industry. While the COVID-19 pandemic has
                    disproportionately affected these industries, there are
                    buyers willing to look past the pandemic to acquire the best
                    locations and assets to launch their concepts.

                    Benefits of Selling a Closed Business for the Seller
                  </h4>
                  <p className="text-start">
                    If things aren’t going as planned for your business due to
                    unforeseen circumstances (such as a pandemic or other market
                    forces), what do you do? Unless you have the capital to
                    allow yourself the time to turn things around, you can
                    either simply walk away and turn in the keys to your
                    landlord (who may have claim to your business assets as
                    collateral against your lease), or try to find a willing
                    buyer for the physical assets of your business. Here are
                    some situations where it is worthwhile to consider the
                    latter:

                    1) You have made significant leasehold improvements
                  </h4>
                  <p className="text-start">
                    If you have made significant leasehold improvements in the
                    form of build-out or the installation of custom equipment, a
                    new operator may value these and should be willing to pay
                    you versus having to take on this work himself. Matt
                    Coletta, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at M&A Business
                    Advisors in California helped a client in a similar
                    situation recently. The business was a high end, high volume
                    day spa in the wine country that had previously invested
                    over $500,000 in improvements and equipment. The business
                    was closed due to the pandemic and the owner needed to
                    relocate out of the area. Rather than simply walk away from
                    the lease, Coletta was able to find a buyer and helped
                    renegotiate the lease with a cooperative landlord to provide
                    front-end rent relief for the buyer. In terms of valuations
                    for a “Sale of Assets in Place”, Coletta offers: “every deal
                    is unique and is ultimately valued based on what a willing
                    buyer and willing seller agree to. In this case, the
                    business was generating significant cash flow pre-pandemic,
                    so the buyer had confidence in the potential down the road.”
                    The business was sold at a significant discount, but the
                    seller was able to generate some funds from the sale and
                    Coletta was able to terminate the seller’s existing lease
                    that had 3 years remaining on the term.

                    2) You have material physical assets in the form of FF&E,
                    licenses, intellectual property or inventory
                  </h4>
                  <p className="text-start">
                    Sometimes the physical assets of the closed business may
                    carry enough value themselves to warrant pursuing a sale.
                    For example, in the bar and restaurant industries, liquor
                    licenses are a valuable and coveted asset. Similarly,
                    specialized cooking, refrigeration, and cleaning equipment
                    is of value to a new restaurant operator. The sale of assets
                    is extremely common in the restaurant sector, where starting
                    from scratch can take a year or even longer before becoming
                    fully operational, often due to lengthy permitting
                    processes. In other sectors, such as manufacturing, there
                    may be extensive value in existing infrastructure or in
                    specialized factory equipment, inventory, or intellectual
                    property that can be repurposed by another manufacturer.

                    3) You have a great location and a landlord who will
                    transfer the lease to the new tenant
                  </h4>
                  <p className="text-start">
                    If you have a great location that will be in demand with
                    other operators and you own the real estate, you are in the
                    driver’s seat. But even if you are in a leased location, and
                    it’s a strong location, you may have leverage in selling
                    your business assets. Steve Zimmerman, Principal Broker and
                    Owner of Restaurant Realty Company in the San Francisco Bay
                    Area explains: “If you can bring a new tenant to your
                    landlord, you save your landlord having to pay a lease
                    commission to lease up the closed space. Additionally, if
                    the landlord has a chance to obtain a new tenant with
                    significant operational experience and a strong financial
                    position, the landlord may be willing to negotiate a
                    favorable lease transfer to the new operator that works for
                    everyone and removes the lease obligation from the exiting
                    owner”.

                    Benefits of Buying a Closed Business for the Buyer
                  </h4>
                  <p className="text-start">
                    Many buyers are specifically looking for closed businesses
                    because they offer the right location, time savings to
                    market, and good value. This path is particularly attractive
                    to experienced business operators with the know-how to
                    effectively leverage the assets of the closed business. Many
                    existing businesses look to expand in this manner by
                    targeting the right opportunities. In a recent BizOwnerSell
                    survey, 14% of business owners who were looking to buy
                    another business were doing so to either upgrade or expand
                    locations. You may want to consider purchasing a closed
                    business’ assets in the following scenarios:
                  </p>
                  <h4 className="my-4 text-start">
                    1) The location is desirable, important, and hard to
                    replicate
                  </h4>
                  <p className="text-start">
                    It’s a well-known phrase that the three most important
                    things in real estate are location, location, and location.
                    If you find that location and it happens to be a closed
                    business, don’t automatically dismiss it. While it will
                    carry higher risk than an established business with proven
                    cash flows, if you have the know-how to get a location on
                    its feet, it can pay dividends in the long run. Sometimes
                    high traffic, central locations are what make or break a
                    business. Of course, you should ask yourself why the
                    business wasn’t successful in that location, but it could be
                    that it was the wrong business versus the wrong location, or
                    perhaps the wrong management.

                  <h4 className="my-4 text-start">
                    2) You want to speed up the timeline to open
                  </h4>
                  <p className="text-start">
                    One of the advantages of buying an established business over
                    starting one from scratch is the time-frame to profits.
                    Successful established businesses are already generating
                    profits. Start-ups can take a long time to get there, and
                    many fail before ever doing so. Buying the assets of a
                    closed business gives you an option somewhere in the middle.
                    You are not starting from zero and will have assets that can
                    be more quickly deployed towards generating income.
                    Build-out, securing equipment, licenses, permits, and the
                    like can be time consuming endeavors versus starting with
                    the assets of a closed business which can give you a
                    significant head-start, and at a lower price point than
                    buying an operating business.

                  <h4 className="my-4 text-start">Summary</h4>
                  <p className="text-start">
                    In every major economic down-cycle, whether brought on by a
                    dot.com bubble, financial crisis, or pandemic, there are
                    always businesses who unfortunately cannot weather the storm
                    and are forced to close their doors. The owners of these
                    businesses should realize that they can get some value for
                    the assets of their business even when it is not a viable
                    ongoing concern. Consult with a professional business broker
                    to see if your closed business can be sold for the value of
                    its assets or location. Buyers should also recognize that
                    these down-cycles often present unprecedented opportunities.
                    Online marketplaces such as BizOwnerSell.com offer the ability
                    to search for business assets for sale. As Warren Buffet has
                    famously stated, opportunity waits for those willing to be
                    greedy when others are fearful. Great companies emerge
                    during every recession, and this time should be no
                    different.
